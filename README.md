# CI/CD Demo - Wercker Container Pipeline

## Demo Introduction

This repository contains the code for the WorkBetter application demo. This demo will walk you through the process of moving an existing application into a containerised CI/CD pipeline and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

You will take on the role of a developer, responsible for configuring the automated build and deploy process that involve details about the application itself. To containerise and automate the building and deploying of this application you will make use of Wercker Pipelines, Oracle Container Registry, and Oracle Cloud Infrastrastructure. The Kubernetes infrastructure will be configured and provisioned through Terraform Installer.

On every pipeline execution, the code goes through the following steps:

1. Code is pulled from Github, built, tested and deployed to Kubernetes
2. The Docker image is pushed to the internal Oracle Container Registry
3. The application is then tested
3. If passed, the image will be pulled from the registy and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster


## Time to Complete

Approximately 20 minutes


## Scenario

You are an application developer who is developing a brand new container native HR application using JET for building the web application to be used in a browser from a mobile phone up to desptop. This web application is designed as a microservice to run in a Docker container and deployed over Kubenetes.

The reason why you want to adopt a container native approach has partially been driven by the need to go to market quicker, by delivering new features more frequently, but also more reliably. And you are able to do this by developing Microservices that has less dependencies on other services, as well as the footprint being smaller, easier to deploy and starts up faster. Whatâ€™s also attractive with Microservices is that you can use the best programming language for the job. To be able to deliver this new style of container native application approach, you will need to adopt the Agile development practice to continuously integrate and deliver these services and features. The application basically consists of the user interfact that is built using Oracle JET framework, packaged as a Docker image and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

# Provision an Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes

## Preparing Container Engine for Kubernetes

Before you can use Container Engine for Kubernetes to create a Kubernetes cluster:

- You must have access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy

- Your tenancy must have sufficient quota on different types of resource
  - at least one compute instance (node) must be available in the tenancy or three compute instances (one in each availability domain) to create a highly available cluster.
  - at least one load balancer to distribute traffic between the nodes running a service in a Kubernetes cluster

- A suitably pre-configured compartment must already exist in each region in which you want to create and deploy clusters. If you are using a GSE environment, then you should use the Demo compartment and api.user as the local OCI login account.
  - The compartment must contain the necessary network resources already configured (VCN, subnets, internet gateway, route table, security lists)
